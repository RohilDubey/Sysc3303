duplicate packet case method
client -> turn on verbose(fix quiet mode) -> turn on test sim (fix menu refresh) -> sim menu (normal, lose packet, delay packet, duplicate packet, should show
prior to sending the RRQ/WRQ) -> pick duplicate -> asks which packet do you want to duplicate from user (rrq/wrq, data/ack) -> duplicate the packet specified to the server
-> server should throw error based upon proper error and send the packet to the client


1) duplicate rrq/wrq must not be acknowledged, one per client at a time
2) throw correct error based on the duplication
